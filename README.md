<h1 align="center">LIBFT</h1>

## Description :clipboard:
<p>
Libft - my very first own library! This project's <em>mandatory part</em> was deisgned to recreate - from scratch - some functions used in C, aiming to understand its processes and functionalities, implementing and learning to use them. <em>The bonus part</em> was about <b>linked lists</b> manipulation.

<b> *** This library is used in most of my 42 - Lisbon projects *** </b>

External functions used: `write()`, `malloc()` and `free()`.

For more information about Libft's Subject [click here](https://github.com/pedromessetti/libft/blob/master/subject.pdf). The library and functions were written following the rules described in the 42 [Norme](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf).
